<h1>Triangle Area Calculation</h1>
<p>This code provides an implementation for calculating the area of a triangle, given its height and base.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>
The code defines a Triangle struct with two fields, height and base, which represent the height and base of the triangle, respectively. 
The code also implements a main function that creates an instance of the Triangle struct and calculates its area using the area function. 
Finally, the area of the triangle is printed to the console.
</p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p>The area function calculates the area of a triangle by multiplying the triangle's height and base, and dividing the result by 2. 
The calculation is performed by first casting the base and height fields of the Triangle struct to f32, so that floating-point arithmetic can be used. 
The function takes a reference to a Triangle struct as its argument, and returns the result as a f32.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This code provides a simple and straightforward way to calculate the area of a triangle, given its height and base. 
By using the Triangle struct and the area function, you can easily perform this calculation in your own Rust code.</p>
